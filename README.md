# Modern React Workshop

These are the code examples used in the latest modern react workshop.

Branches follow this naming convention, so you should be able to tab-complete your target branch easily:

```
day-<day-number>/<topic-number>-<topic-name>/<start|end|example>
```

- `/start` branches are meant as a starting point for an exercise.
  - If you want to peek at the solution, check out the respective `/solution` branch.
  - There is no solution for `day-1/4-exercise/start`, since you're not supposed to peek.
- `/example ` branches are just for show-casing something and not for you to actively work on.
